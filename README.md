This Project I scraped the mortality rate for every age, gender, and country from https://www.mortality.org/. Since these files were not in any default format I had to write code to parse the files myself. An example of an unparsed file can be found here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottrobel/mort_calc/master/example_unparsed_mortality_table.txt. These files are converted into a JSON of mortality data grouped by country and gender. Once I had this data I wrote Javascript to calculate the lifespan from these tables.I used "segmentation inputs" to group the user by country and gender and find what group of data they belong to.If the data in the JSON becomes outdated you run data_scraper.rb and it will overwrite mortality_data.json with the most upto date data from https://www.mortality.org/.
